## The Game

- Race with your friends (up to 1000 players)
- Drive with the Android/Iphone app or the 3D printed remote
- Watch real time score boards and lap times: each car has a sensor that detect specially designed gates.
- Re-program the Arduino core inside each car to unlock new features from the community

## Folders

- stl: the latest 3D printable models of each car, fully functional models
- minis: static models: a scaled version of the cars for display only. You'll also find there the car accessories (bumpers, spoilers, wheels, etc.)
- customization: The holes and pins to use to design your own accessories. For the template to create a 3DRacers car body see: [Model Template](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eMrdzYMlwBJ-3dracers-model-kit)

## The PCB board

3DRacers is Open Source an Open Hardware, check out also the [PCB board sources]
